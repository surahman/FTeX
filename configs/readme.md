### Security Note

Configuration files are provided in this directory in both their plaintext and `age` encrypted Mozilla Secret OPerationS
(`SOPS`) format.

The plaintext files with the `YAML` file extension are provided to facilitate a less complicated review of this
demonstration project. In an actual production system, this would pose a security risk. As such, the configurations have
additionally been included in this directory in the `SOPS` format using the `age` encryption tooling.
